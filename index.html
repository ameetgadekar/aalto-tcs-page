           Welcome to CS theory at Aalto! 
          </h1> </a>
		  <p> This is the homepage of Theoretical <a href="https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-computer-science">Computer Science</a> group at <a href="https://www.aalto.fi/en">Aalto University</a>, Finland.
		  
		  <p> <mark>Background</mark> The Department of Computer Science provides world-class research and education in modern computer science to foster future science, engineering and society. The work combines fundamental research with innovative applications.<p>

		  <p> With over 40 professors and more than 400 employees it is the largest department at Aalto University and the largest Computer Science unit in Finland. It is routinely ranked among the top 10 Computer Science departments in Europe and in the top 100 globally. The department is part of the School of Science in Aalto University, located on the Otaniemi campus. <p>
		  
		  <p> More dummy text. Our current research focuses on the foundations of distributed computing. The key research question is related to the concept of locality in the context large computer networks. There are many computational tasks that are of a global nature: to solve such a task, it is necessary to transfer information over a long distance, from one side of the network to another. However, there are also tasks that are of a local nature: it is sufficient for each network device to gather information from its own local neighbourhood. Our research team conducts basic research that aims at understanding which computational tasks are local and which are global.<p>
		  
		  <p> Some more dummy. The group seeks to understand, model, and program naturally occurring or nature-inspired self-organising processes. The current main focus is on DNA and RNA self-assembly, but related areas of interest are e.g. algorithms for swarm robotics and programmable matter, control of distributed sensor networks, and stochastic optimisation methods for complex energy landscapes.<p>
		  
		  <p> Again dummy.Our group studies various aspects of efficient computations, including for instance approximation algorithms, online algorithms, exact algorithms, combinatorial optimization, and data structures. We focus on studying combinatorial questions that arise in studying these computational questions. We focus on studying combinatorial questions that arise in studying these computational questions. <p>
